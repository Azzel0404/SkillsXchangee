# Frontend

This directory is reserved for the future frontend application.

## Planned Technologies

- Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
- API integration with Laravel backend
- Responsive design
- State management
- Component-based architecture

## Future Structure

```

│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── assets/
├── public/

└── README.md
```

## Getting Started (Future)

1. Choose a frontend framework
2. Set up the project structure
3. Configure API integration
4. Implement authentication
5. Build the user interface

## API Integration

The frontend will communicate with the Laravel backend API located in the `../backend` directory.

### API Endpoints (Future)

- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Users: `/api/users/*`
- Skills: `/api/skills/*`
- Trades: `/api/trades/*`
- Messages: `/api/messages/*`

## Development

Once implemented, development will involve:

1. Setting up the development environment
2. Installing dependencies
3. Running the development server
4. Hot reloading for development
5. Building for production

**Note**: This frontend is not yet implemented. The current application uses Laravel's Blade templates for the frontend.
